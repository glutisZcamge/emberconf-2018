## What is Redsn0w 0.8.15b3?
 
Redsn0w 0.8.15b3 is a jailbreak tool that exploits a vulnerability in the iPhone firmware to gain root access and install a custom bootloader and firmware on your device. This allows you to run unsigned code and applications that are not approved by Apple, such as Cydia, a package manager that lets you download and install thousands of apps and tweaks for your jailbroken iPhone.
 
Redsn0w 0.8.15b3 also offers some additional features, such as:
 
- Activate and deactivate iPhone
- Install custom bootloaders
- Create custom IPSW files
- Install Cydia packages
- Create custom DFU IPSW files
- Restore to earlier iOS versions
- Flash the NOR on iPhone 3GS
- Put device in Pwned DFU mode
- Exit recovery mode loop
- Fetch SHSH blobs for downgrading
- Connect to device over SSH
- Select IPSW files manually
- Boot tethered jailbroken devices
- Unlock iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS

If you have a late-model iPhone 3GS, or if you have an iPod touch 2G whose serial number begins with âMCâ (newer than week 40 of last year), you can use redsn0w to jailbreak but you are currently restricted to âtetheredâ rebooting. That means you need to connect your device to a computer each time you boot it â so just try no to reboot.
